# research_software

This repository contains scripts I have used for research in mathematics. The
description of each folder is as follows:
- `tau` contains code used for researching the tau constant of a metric graph.
  All of the software is written in Sage.  I am currently working with this
folder.
- `voronoi_decomposition` contains code related to a zonotopal subdivision of
  the voronoi polytope of a metric graph I am working on with
[Amzi](https://www.math.cmu.edu/~amzij/) and
[Farbod](https://sites.math.washington.edu/~farbod/). All of the software is written in sage
- `quantum_graph` contains software written in Mathematica to generate and
  study the secular determinant of a quantum graph.
- `chip_firing` contains software written in Sage to study the combinatorial
  properties of chip firing on a graph.
- `dual_variety` contains plots of the dual variety of various curves on the
  plain written in Mathematica.
